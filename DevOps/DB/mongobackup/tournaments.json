An arcadian, in its premise, is a tournament meant to encourage newer and lower-level players to compete by means of removing the top-ranked talent from the equation.","The Georgia Arcadian showcased our commitment to delivering high-quality events in a community-focused manner. From an organizing perspective, the goal of the event was to bring the techniques and improvements often seen in national, big-budget tournaments and prove they can be scaled to a local level. This meant properly investing in equipment such as signage, printing, and photography, as well as focusing on logistics in a way that left players saying it \"felt like a national\"."],"__v":0}
